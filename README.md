# The-3-Ws
A repo for 3 projects: some web applications written from scratch, with explanations as content, using various frameworks.

This idea came to be as a result of trying to educate myself on various web frameworks after spending a lot of time either in school or working through issues. Here are quick summaries on each project, specifying my goals for each, and the tools I plan to use to get there:

Project 1 - Game(s)
- Goal - To replicate a simple game where the player is chased around by an enemy.
- Tools:
  1. a
  2. b
  3. c

Project 2 - Database
- Goal - Implement a simple article publication website, with users and themes.
- Tools:
  1. Backend - Wordpress
  2. Frontend - Vue.js
  3. c

Project 3 - The Product! (tm)
- Goal - Implement a website with flashy presentation of some object (the titular Product(tm)) that can run smoothly across a variety of devices and connections.
- Tools:
  1. a
  2. b
  3. c
